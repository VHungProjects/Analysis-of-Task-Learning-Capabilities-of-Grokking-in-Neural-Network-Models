# An Analysis of Task Learning Capabilities of Grokking in Neural Network Models
University Course Project exploring the grokking phenomenon in neural networks -- generalization far after overfitting -- The goal here is to analyze and demonstrate how what types of tasks are capable of producing this same grokking phenomenon as presented in [Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting on Small Algorithmic Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177).

### Tasks/Datasets Used
